<p>Hail, chief</p>
<p><a href="..\Definitions\Nation.html">Our people</a> changed their ways. We don’t chase prey in forests and steppes, nor we move our tents anymore, - we settled, and ploughed our fields.</p>
<p>Look at this place. We call it <a href="..\Definitions\settlement.html">village</a>, and most of us will spend whole of our lives here. You can live here, too, and so can your warriors.</p>

<p>Some of us plough fields, - we call them <a href="..\Definitions\farm.html">farmers</a>. Others preferred to fine their skills in crafts, and exchange the things they created for food. We call them <a href="..\Definitions\CrafterWorkshop.html">crafters</a>. Another help people to build their houses for food, and we call them <a href="..\Definitions\CrafterWorkshop.html">builders</a>.</p>
