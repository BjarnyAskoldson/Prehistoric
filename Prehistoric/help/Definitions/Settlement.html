<h2>Settlement</h2>

<p>Settlement, oh chief, is a place where people exchange their goods. Farmers may live way outside the village, but they will make their way here for market day. This is the reason why those who not linked to land live here, - crafters, builders and others. Note, oh chief, that those scums who couldn’t find a job is also usually here, begging and stealing. </p>
<p> Important thing here is working places set by our hard-working people. Here they create goods that farmers are always happy to exchange for food. </p>
<p>Every settlement has a granary, - it contains grain collected as taxes, to be distributed between those who serves you, chief.</p>
 <p>Also, it has armoury. It contains weapons you can give to your soldiers, - make sure you always ordered the weapons ahead of your army expansion, for producing of weapons will take time for our crafters.</p>
