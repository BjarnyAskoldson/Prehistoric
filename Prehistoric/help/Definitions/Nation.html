<h2>Nation </h2> 

<p>Nation is a group of people under single government. First proto-nations, - tribes, had rather vague borders. Important thing is that all people in tribe pays taxes, <a href=".\Enterprises.html">whatever they do for living</a>. </p>

<p>Our tribe, oh chief, is not the only one around. There may be others who settled, - it is up to you how will we treat them. Many other tribes are still skilful hunters, roaming the land, and there is no place they call home. Neither they have a leader to speak with. They are often jealous and greedy, and they want our bread and goods. </p>
<p>Your warriors are brave and strong, - could you protect us from these nasty strangers? We will gladly provide your people with bread they need, - this is the taxes. This is up to you, chief, to decide how much of taxes you want, but I ask you to keep them fair. Our people will be unhappy should taxes become a burden, - they can refuse to pay, or cheat you. You can suppress them, but that will irritate them even more, and they can riot. </p>
<p>Should your warriors fail to protect our people in time of need, they will become angry too. </p>

<p>So, oh chief, every nation consist of settlements. It also has armies and knowledge accumulated by our people for years. </p>
