<h2>Enterprise</h2>

<p>Our people, oh chief, constantly looking for ways to get their daily bread. It can be done in one of two ways. </p>

<p> First, they can start produce something. Most people prefer to work on fields, and grow food. To start, they need a piece of land to work on, or a workshop with tools. They pay for it a fair price ahead, - this grain goes to your granary, chief </p>

<p> Those who cannot buy a piece of land or tools, can join the owners as workers. Farmers or master crafters provide them with tools and land, and pay for their work. In exchange, owners got all the products, and sell them in the market </p>

<p> If owner sold products for more than he paid to workers, he got profit, and can expand the enterprise, - buy additional land and tools, and hire more workers. If revenue was less than wages, it is loss, and owner will cut some jobs </p>

<p> Amount of products sold is limited by total productiveness of workers, resources available and <a href="../Concepts/demand.html">demand</a> on the product in the market. Crafter cannot sell more flint tools, than we have flint. Neither can he sell more tools, than people want to buy </p>

<p> Each enterprise has number of workers (including owner), and assets. They told us their profit every year, so that we could calculate the taxes </p>
