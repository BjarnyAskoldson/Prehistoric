<p>Demand, chief, is how much of certain things our people are willing to buy. It depends on following: </p>

<p> Every person need to eat, thus demand on food is equal to number of people in the village </p>
<p> Every person want to buy some crafted goods, however wealthier people buy more fine goods from specialist crafters, while poorer people prefer craft things themselves and save for new house </p>
